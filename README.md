## üîå MG4 Integration

### Current Implementation
The prototype currently uses simulated MG4 data for development and demonstration purposes. The data includes:

- **Battery Management**: 64 kWh capacity, real-time percentage and range
- **Performance Metrics**: Efficiency tracking, power consumption, temperature
- **Location Services**: GPS coordinates, heading, and speed
- **Maintenance Data**: Tire pressure monitoring, service schedules

### Real MG4 Integration
To connect to your actual MG4, you'll need to implement the following:

#### Option 1: OBD-II Connection
```javascript
// Example OBD-II integration
const connectToMG4 = async () => {
  try {
    // Connect to OBD-II port via Bluetooth/WiFi
    const connection = await obd.connect({
      device: 'MG4_OBD',
      protocol: 'ISO15765-4_11bit_500k'
    });
    
    // Read battery data
    const batteryLevel = await connection.read('BATTERY_LEVEL');
    const range = await connection.read('RANGE_ESTIMATE');
    
    return { batteryLevel, range };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('MG4 connection failed:', error);
  }
};
```

#### Option 2: MG4 Mobile App API
```javascript
// Example MG4 app API integration
const fetchMG4Data = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://mg4-api.example.com/vehicle/status', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${MG4_API_TOKEN}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

#### Option 3: CAN Bus Integration
```javascript
// Example CAN bus data reading
const readCANData = async () => {
  const canData = await canBus.read({
    id: '0x123', // MG4 battery module ID
    length: 8
  });
  
  // Parse battery data from CAN message
  const batteryLevel = parseBatteryLevel(canData);
  return batteryLevel;
};
```

### Required Data Points
For full MG4 integration, you'll need access to:

1. **Battery System**
   - Current battery percentage
   - Estimated range
   - Charging status and rate
   - Battery temperature

2. **Vehicle Performance**
   - Current speed
   - Efficiency (km/kWh)
   - Power consumption
   - Regenerative braking data

3. **Location & Navigation**
   - GPS coordinates
   - Heading/direction
   - Trip distance and time

4. **Maintenance**
   - Tire pressure (all four wheels)
   - Service intervals
   - Error codes and diagnostics

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Integration

The application uses Leaflet with a dark theme for optimal visibility. Charging stations are displayed with:

- **Color-coded markers**: Based on charging speed (ultra-fast, fast, standard)
- **Real-time availability**: Live status updates
- **Detailed information**: Power rating, pricing, amenities
- **Range circles**: Visual representation of current range
